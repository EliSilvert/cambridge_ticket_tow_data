# TowZoneAlerts-Public
Cambridge's tow logs and ticket logs were made public through their Open Data program, and the data is visualized here to understand the reasons for towing, who's doing the towing, and the correlation between towing and tickets due to street cleaning and snow removal. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the market for TowZoneAlerts.com, a text-alert service that warns people when their car is about to be towed.
